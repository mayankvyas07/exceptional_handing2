    "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Exception class is the base class for all exceptions in Python. When you create a custom exception, you typically want it to inherit from the Exception class or one of its subclasses. This is because inheriting from Exception allows your custom exception to follow the established exception hierarchy and be caught by broader exception handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By inheriting from the Exception class, your custom exception gains several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "It becomes part of the exception hierarchy, making it easier to organize and categorize your custom exceptions.\n",
    "It can be caught by a broader except block that catches Exception or its subclasses, providing a more general way to handle exceptions.\n",
    "It inherits the behavior and attributes of the Exception class, allowing you to customize error messages and behaviors as needed.\n",
    "Q2. Write a Python program to print Python Exception Hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple program to print the Python Exception Hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def print_exception_hierarchy(exception_class, indent=0):\n",
    "    print(\"  \" * indent + str(exception_class))\n",
    "    for subclass in exception_class.__subclasses__():\n",
    "        print_exception_hierarchy(subclass, indent + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "print_exception_hierarchy(BaseException)\n",
    "Q3. What errors are defined in the ArithmeticError class? Explain any two with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ArithmeticError class is the base class for exceptions that occur during arithmetic operations. Some errors that are subclasses of ArithmeticError include ZeroDivisionError, OverflowError, and FloatingPointError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "This error occurs when you try to divide by zero.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught ZeroDivisionError:\", e)\n",
    "OverflowError:\n",
    "This error occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be represented.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 ** 10000\n",
    "except OverflowError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught OverflowError:\", e)\n",
    "Q4. Why LookupError class is used? Explain with examples KeyError and IndexError.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LookupError class is the base class for exceptions that occur when a lookup or indexing operation is unsuccessful. It provides a way to handle errors related to looking up values in data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, or sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "KeyError:\n",
    "This error occurs when you try to access a dictionary key that doesn't exist.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    my_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n",
    "    value = my_dict[\"c\"]\n",
    "except KeyError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught KeyError:\", e)\n",
    "IndexError:\n",
    "This error occurs when you try to access an index that is out of range in a sequence.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    value = my_list[10]\n",
    "except IndexError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught IndexError:\", e)\n",
    "Q5. Explain ImportError. What is ModuleNotFoundError?\n",
    "\n",
    "ImportError: This exception is raised when an import statement cannot find the module being imported or when there is an error in the imported module.\n",
    "ModuleNotFoundError: This is a subclass of ImportError. It is specifically raised when the module you're trying to import cannot be found.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    import non_existent_module\n",
    "except ModuleNotFoundError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught ModuleNotFoundError:\", e)\n",
    "Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use specific exception classes whenever possible.\n",
    "Avoid using bare except statements; catch only the exceptions you expect.\n",
    "Use the finally block for cleanup code that should run regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n",
    "Don't suppress exceptions by using an empty except block.\n",
    "Avoid nesting too many try blocks; refactor your code for better readability.\n",
    "Provide meaningful error messages that help users understand the issue.\n",
    "Use with statements for handling resources that need to be cleaned up (e.g., file handling).\n",
    "When catching multiple exceptions, use parentheses to group them.\n",
    "If you're not sure which exceptions a piece of code might raise, catch Exception at the highest level and log the error.\n",
    "Keep exception handling close to the source of the exception and avoid handling exceptions too far up the call stack."
